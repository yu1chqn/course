			<p>Japan is known for a lot of things—cutting-edge technology, manga, beautiful landscapes, a long history reflected in the temples, shrines and castles—but one thing everybody seems to have an interest in is the food. Not only do the visitors to Japan fall in love with the flavours, the Japanese themselves are so attached that when they go travelling overseas, many of them will search for a Japanese restaurant.</p>
			<p>So why is Japanese food so good? Here I'll try to uncover the secret to the great food in Japan (traditional dishes as well as those taken from other cultures) by taking a look at how the Japanese themselves describe what they like about the food in their own country.</p>
			<h3>Describing Taste</h3>
			<p>The most obvious and straightforward way of describing food for most people is the taste. Oishii and umai both describe something that is good or delicious. However, this is an overall impression of the taste and doesn’t really tell us much about what exactly the speaker likes about the food. So, let’s get down to the words that give us a clue.</p>
			<h3>Sweet/Salty</h3>
			<p>Amai (sweet) or amakarai (sweet and salty) are words that are often heard when people are impressed by traditional Japanese dishes. This leads me to believe that the Japanese generally like sauces on the sweeter side. Just look at their staple ingredients used in traditional cooking: mirin (sweet rice wine), sugar, cooking sake and soy sauce. The combination of the syrupy mirin and sugar, with the soy sauce full of umami, creates a dish that is both sweet and salty.</p>
			<h3>Mild</h3>
			<p>Maroyaka means mild, which is a nice way of saying that something doesn’t have a whole lot of punch to it. Some dishes which can at times be too overpowering and bold, such as ramen or stews, can be described as maroyaka—not to say it has no flavour, but to indicate that it is just the right balance (or light as opposed to rich).</p>
			<p>This is related to johin, which means elegant or refined and can be used to point out a flavour that is a class above the regular and doesn’t have to be masked by bold seasonings. Yasashii is also used often to describe something nice and light in flavour.</p>
			<h3>Rich</h3>
			<p>Nohkoh is a word to convey a rich flavour. I often hear it used when talking about dishes involving eggs. The Japanese, being one of the top consumers of eggs, really seem to like the rich yolks. They even breed top brands of chickens to yield eggs with a supposedly nohkoh flavour (these are of course more expensive than the regular egg).</p>
			<p>Koi, in the context of adjectives, means bold and rich (many people may know the noun, meaning ‘carp’). It is similar to nohkoh, however with koi you have to be more careful since it can have a negative connotation meaning something is over-seasoned.</p>
			<h3>Non-Fishy/Non-Gamey</h3>
			<p>Kusakunai, although literally means “it doesn’t smell”, often refers to the taste when talking about food. Sometimes seafood dishes will have a fishy taste to them, but if made with a fresh catch, one might say kusakunai. This is generally true for any culture; however, the story is different in Japan with game meat. Lamb, for example, has a particular gamey flavour and that’s what lamb eaters (like me) love about it.</p>
			<p>The Japanese, however, when they like a dish of lamb, usually say ‘kusakunai!’, meaning that the meat and its preparation was successful in lessening the gaminess. Lamb raised in Japan somehow has a less gamey flavour (probably related to the feed and environment they create for them).</p>
			<h3>Toasty</h3>
			<p>Kohbashii describes something with a nice char or toastiness. For example, a good cup of barley or hojicha tea, both teas that are made from roasted ingredients, can be kohbashii. Vegetables, as well as meat, can also be called kohbashii when they have been stir-fried or barbequed with a char which acts to enhance the overall flavours. This word can be used to describe the scent of something as well, although I do not hear it as often.</p>
			<h3>Smell vs. Taste</h3>
			<p>You may have noticed that I haven’t created a category for describing smells. This is because food can smell good but taste horrible and vice versa. It doesn’t seem to be a deciding factor in good food; just look at natto or the fermented beans that so many Japanese people eat on a daily basis (they themselves also think it’s smelly).</p>
			<p>These shrimps breaded with panko and fried are sure to be saku-saku and puri-puri.</p>
			<h3>Describing Textures</h3>
			<p>Taste is not the only important thing to the Japanese. They pay almost as much attention to texture as they do to the taste buds.</p>
			<h3>Soft Textures</h3>
			<p>Fuwa-fuwa essentially means soft and fluffy, and is used to describe a lot of things from pancakes, bread and sponge cakes to omelettes and okonomiyaki (a savoury, cabbage and meat-filled batter cooked on an iron plate, covered with an amakarai sauce). I have noticed that the Japanese tend to like the lighter and fluffier cakes (chiffon and sponge cakes are quite popular) as opposed to the dense kind.</p>
			<p>Nameraka is often used to describe something that is smooth and silky with no chunks in it, such as a pudding.</p>
			<p>Kuriimi actually comes from the English word for, you guessed it, creamy. If you ask for a chicken stew in Japan you'll get a white stew where the creamy appeal comes from whipping cream or milk as its base. Corn potage is a type of soup you’ll find in many family restaurants in Japan and is liked for its creaminess in addition to its sweetness.</p>
			<p>Toro-toro is used for liquids that are thick or sticky in a good way. Back to the beloved egg, a half-cooked omlette or a runny egg (which are the key to a few standard dishes here) are described as toro-toro.</p>
			<p>Meat that has been braised for hours and melts in your mouth is also said to be toro-toro. Since it’s the fat in meat that makes it soft, and the Japanese tend to go for soft meat, you can see why the fattier meat is prized here. In addition to the umami in the fat, it plays a big role in making the meat really tender (which is why the most expensive meat here is so beautifully marbled).</p>
			<p>Torokeru and tokeru also have the meaning of ‘melt-in-your-mouth’, but can also be used for velvety chocolate desserts and really soft, smooth puddings or super fluffy pancakes made airy with meringue.</p>
			<h3>Crispy Textures</h3>
			<p>Saku-saku is an onomatopoeic word for crispy. It is used when biting into tempura done well with a light and crispy batter. Things that have been breaded with panko and then fried come out saku-saku especially when eaten straight after frying, which anybody will probably agree is the best time to eat fried foods.</p>
			<p>Shaki-shaki is used for something that has a nice crunch to it. Certain vegetables, such as cabbage or bean sprouts, remain shaki-shaki even after briefly adding heat to them and these seem appealing to the Japanese. When raw vegetables are described as shaki-shaki it can be validation for its freshness. The Japanese often serve shredded cabbage alongside fried items or in salads, and to make it extra shaki-shaki, they will soak it in cold water for a few minutes.</p>
			<p>Other Textures: Juicy and Slippery</h3>
			<p>Puri-puri is desirable in seafood such as shrimp or lobster and is used to describe a juicy piece of meat. When a shrimp is over-cooked it becomes rubbery and stiff but when it’s cooked to perfection it is puri-puri. Some jelly-like desserts can have the same bouncy burst when you bit into it and these can also be puri-puri.</p>
			<p>Tsuru-tsuru literally means slippery, smooth or shiny, and is used when eating noodles. It basically tells how slurpable the noodles are. The Japanese love to slurp their udon or soba noodles because they believe it makes it taste better (it’s like wrapping spaghetti on a fork, you get one big mouthful of it when you keep slurping the long noodles). It’s also easier to eat noodles this way as that’s how they've probably learned to eat them at a young age.</p>
